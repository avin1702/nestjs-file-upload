There are 2 folders 
file-upload and react-file-upload
file-upload folder contains the backend and react-file-upload contains the react frontend for the same.
To run the backend just 
cd into file-upload folder 
`run npm i`

`npm run start` to start the server

to start the front-end cd to react-file-upload
`run npm i` to install dependencies
`run npm start` to start the frontend server

Once the frontend has started you will see `select file` button and `upload` button 

you can use the `data.txt` to test the upload part
